Mongo Compass opened
seemed to work, I can access databases I had created in 4.4.3
when I run Mongo at CMD: mongo
the shell seems to be 4.4.3 but the server 5.0

went to: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell
says I can download 1.1.1
downloaded and instaleld 1.1.1
mongo
mongo shell is still 4.4.3
found a 5.03 shell download here: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise/releases
file is: mongodb-windows-x86_64-enterprise-5.0.3-signed.msi
got a conflict:

we don't need this
we want to repoint the environment path to 5.0.3 instead of 4.4.3
found in environment path system variables: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin
under C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server we have 4.2, 4.4, 5.0
changed to: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin
and fixed mongorc.js problem
Windows virtual machine without Mongo installed yet
downloaded and installing: mongodb-windows-x86_64-5.0.3-signed.msi

version 1.1.1
installed
in c:\edward the command mongosh works (path already set up, found in user environment variables: c:\Users\oweir\AppData\Local\Programs\mongosh\)

fixing mongorc.js problem
in file explorer, go to %UserProfile%
copied .mongorc.js (which was empty) to .mongoshrc.js
error gone
fixing error "Access control is not enabled..."
will do this later, has to do with user access but access is now open for dev environment
get mongo to work as well
in c:\edward the command mongo is still unrecognized
going to c:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin then mongo works:

setting environment path
WINDOWS KEY, 'path'
add system variables path:

works now in c:\edward
